Using DevOps Methodology:
A set f practices intended  to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal into normal production, while ensuring high quality. 

Codepipeline:
Create a pipeline and all the process can be automated. It is a continous delivery service you can use to model, visualize and automate the steps required to release your software. 


CodeBuild is a build service. We can define the environment such as Python, Ruby , Docker and Go. For instance, our application is written by Python. And we need to an environment to run unit test when a developer commit code. If the unit test fails , there is an alarm to notify other developers. We can configure some tasks such as building artifacts, building docker images and deploy processes.

CodePipeline is a service which combine CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and Source by order. For example, in step one, we can configure where contains source code such as Github, CodeCommit , S3 or Bitbucket. In step 2, we can configure CodeBuild to run Unit Test. In step 3, we can configure CodeBuild to build artifacts . In step 4, we can configure build docker images. In step 5, we can configure CodeDeploy to deploy the application.

ECR is like a docker hub where we can save Docker images. We can pull and push docker images from ECR.

ECS is a docker orchestration tools. It has a range of servers which is called Workers. We can scale up and scale down containers, and also workers ( servers ). It has a user interface where we can manage our infrastructure resources such as Ram, CPU and Container merits easily and effectively. Moreover, it can integrate with other services like CloudWatch Logs for logging.


So this is a basic CI/CD flow to demonstrate how to deploy a Flask application when developers commit the source code.
1. The developer will commit code on Github.
2. The CodePipeline will pull source code when there is any changes.
3. The CodeBuild will run unit test, build a docker image, and push the image to ECR.
4. The CodeBuild will execute a deployment script to deploy application on ECS.



buildspect.yml: This file is used for building docker image by CodeBuild.
deploy.sh: This file is deployment script which is used by CodeBuild
task.json: This is the ECS task template definition.
service.json: This is the ECS service.

















In this post we will create a complete Continuous Delivery Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline, which consists of three stages. In the first stage (called source) the pipeline listens to master commits on the GitHub Repository of interest. The second stage (called build) builds a new docker image of the Dockerfile in the GitHub Repository and pushes the new image to AWS ECR. The last state (called deploy) does a blue/green deployment to ECS with the new image.
